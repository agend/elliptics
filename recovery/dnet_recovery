"""
New recovery mechanism for elliptics that utilizes iterators and metadata.

For now it supports three recovery methods: `merge` and `dc`:
 * `merge` is used for recovery within hash ring (aka group). It uses all nodes from some hash ring.
 * `dc` is used for recovery across different hash rings thus maintaining replica counts.

More information about recovery process can be found at:
